                    <h2>Raising Awareness About Cruelty Towards Dogs</h2>
                    <p>
                    We are a non government organization that aims to 
                    share information about dog cruelty. We are raising awareness about it
                    and we hope to make a change for the world in terms of letting the public
                    understand about dog cruelty and hopefully preventing it from happening.
                    We aimed to spread awareness of global animal rights issues, to shine a 
                    light on the plights of some of the world's most vulnerable and abused 
                    inhabitants. For those who were unaware of the true extent of animal abuse 
                    around the world, we aimed to put this issue in sharp focus. For those who 
                    were well aware of the problems faced by animals of every size and in every 
                    country, we aimed to provide easy ways for you to help and support the 
                    organizations that share the same values as you do.

                    <h1>Dogs are being treated cruelly</h1>
                    <h2>You must know these facts</h2>
                    <p>
                    65% Of Animal Abuse Is Inflicted On Dogs. Dogs are one of the most 
                    out of control domestic animals on the planet. Man's best friend, 
                    being a popular animal to have, is the most likely to be abused. 
                    69 Million households in the U.S. own a dog. Because not everyone 
                    spays and neuters their dogs, their is an overpopulation problem 
                    that leads to this abuse issue. Every 60 Seconds There Is An Animal
                    Suffering Abuse. It is estimated that every minute there is an 
                    animal being mistreated. State laws try to prevent this abuse and 
                    some areas of the U.S. are better than others. Don't turn a blind 
                    eye to animal abuse if you see it. Call your local animal control 
                    if you see suspicious behavior with people and the animals they 
                    care for.

                    <h1>Dogs are our best friend</h1>
                    <h2>Here is why that is the case</h2>
                    <p>
                        1. Unconditional love. We never have to earn a dog's love, and we don't have to love them first. They choose to love us no matter what, wholeheartedly, unquestioningly, absolutely, no strings attached. Even when we don't deserve it, even when we don't love ourselves, even when we're angry that they've torn apart another couch cushion, dogs love us anyway.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. They know us better than we know ourselves. Having a fabulous day? Your dog knows and wants to play. Feeling sick or sad? Your dog can tell and will leave you alone or comfort you (yes, she knows which you need). Now, that's a good friend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. They're smarter than we think. Dogs help military and police departments around the world to sniff out drugs and bombs or to track and locate missing persons. They fearlessly jump out of airplanes to perform rescues or infiltrate war zones. Dogs herd our livestock. Service dogs can sense changes in blood sugar levels or warn their masters about an impending seizure, guide the blind or, just by their presence, help to heal the war-scarred veteran. Between instincts and specialized training, working dogs of all kinds truly are amazing and make wonderful best friends.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. They take care of us. Dogs can literally save your life. They bark when someone comes into the yard, a stranger comes to the door, or a child gets too close to danger. They wake us up if there's a natural disaster or other emergencies in the middle of the night. They sense earthquakes before they strike. Dogs will risk their lives to save yours without question or concern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5. They keep us warm. In the old days humans would cuddle up with pups to stay warm during the harsh winter nights. Many of us still do this.
